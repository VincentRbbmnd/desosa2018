# Journal

This is the journal of team Docker, providing a summary of the things we did each week.

## Week 1

In the first week of this project we formed a group and started looking for suitable open source projects. The projects we found interesting were: [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes), [Docker](https://github.com/docker) and [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript). Our first choice was Kubernetes, but sadly this was already taken by another group.

So then we went for our second choice Docker. The only issue with that was, Docker was already done by a group a few years ago, so we had to come up with a way to differentiate from the previous analysis. At the end of the week we started looking for different components of Docker which we could analyse.

## Week 2
We finally ended up with SwarmKit as our project. The main tasks for this week were as follows:
- Creation of a make script for splitting up the project into separate files for different sections.
- Analysis of 10 pull requests
- Analysis of 10 issues
- Stakeholder Analysis
- Creating a 'power vs interest' grid for stakeholder analysis
- Context View analysis
- Analysis of Integrators and Contributors

We got more comfortable with collaborating via GitHub and are looking forward to our upcoming tasks. ðŸŒ®

## Week 3

In the beginning of this week we focuses on combining the tasks from week 2 and finishing D1. Our new tasks for D2 are:
- Making a first contribution
- Creating a Development view

To be able to make a first contribution, we had to get a better understanding of the project and the way the developers work. By creating a development view, we could get this understanding by describing these different components:
- Component overview / module structure
- Common design models
- Codeline models / dev process

At the end of this week we also made a contribution, more about this can be found in [contributions.md](contributions.md)

## Week 4

During this week we focused on finishing the development view. While making the contribution and creating the development view, we already came across some technical debt issues which could be the base of future contributions.

On Tuesday we received the feedback for D1 and created issues to fix incomplete content. During the end of week 4, we worked on improving this content as well as finishing D2.

## Week 5

In the end of this week, we had to deliver D3, which was the deadline for the technical debt chapter. During this week, we tried to identify the technical debts in the SwarmKit project via various channels.

This week we sent an email to three project integrators, but did not receive a reply yet.

Finally, we also started writing tests on badly tested code, which we could identify after last week's technical debt chapter.  

## Week 6

In week 6 we started with the structure of our final chapter and created issues for files that should be improved and added to the final chapter.

We continued working on writing tests for the poorly tested parts of SwarmKit and searching for other possible contributions.

We sent a reminder to all the integrators and got a reply form Drew Erny, after that we scheduled a meeting with him for week 7.

## Week 7

In this week we had a meeting with Drew, who gave us a lot of insights which we could include in our final chapter. He also gave us a list of possible contributions where we could potentially contribute. We picked one of them and started working on it.

We also continued improving the previous content and writing content for the final chapter.

## Week 8

During this week we focused on adding a final touch to our chapter. Most of the content had already been written and we created a first structure, but the original content needed to be decreased in size and we needed to implement logical styling and ordering throughout all sections. After finishing the draft on Tueseday, we sent our draft chapter to Drew Erny, a member of the docker swarmkit team, and he gave us feedback that we included in the final chapter.

This week we also created a pull request on our Docker SwarmKit fork and are still waiting for feedback from the team. More about our contributions can be found in [contributions.md](contributions.md)

Lastly, we started with our presentation, this presentation was due Friday and we practiced on Thursday and Friday morning.
